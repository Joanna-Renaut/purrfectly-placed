        <h2 id="adoption_header"><u>How to Adopt</u></h2>
        <p>Adopting a cat can be a wonderful experience that brings joy and companionship into your life. There are
            many reasons why adopting a cat is a good idea. First and foremost, adopting a cat from a cat charity can
            save a life. Millions of cats end up in animal shelters every year, and sadly, many of them are euthanized
            simply because there are not enough homes for them. By adopting a cat, you are giving a home to an animal
            in need and saving its life. </p>
       <p>In addition to the joy and companionship that a cat can bring into your life, adopting a cat has many other
           benefits. For example, cats can provide emotional support, reduce stress levels, and even lower blood
           pressure. They are also relatively low-maintenance pets, and many cats can adapt to a variety of living
           situations. Whether you live in a small apartment or a large house, there is likely a cat that will be a
           good fit for your lifestyle.</p>
        <p>To adopt a cat from Purrfectly Placed, interested individuals will need to fill out an adoption application.
            The application will ask questions about your living situation, lifestyle, and previous experience with
            pets. Once we receive your application, our adoption team will review it and contact you to schedule a
            home inspection. During the home inspection, we will assess your living environment to ensure that it is
            safe and suitable for a cat. We will also answer any questions you may have and provide advice on how to
            prepare your home for your new furry friend. Once your application and home inspection are approved, we
            will work with you to find a cat that is a good fit for your lifestyle and needs. We will provide guidance
            on the adoption process and help you choose a cat that is healthy, friendly, and well-behaved. Our team is
            committed to ensuring that each cat finds a loving and permanent home, and we are dedicated to providing
            support and resources to our adopters to help them care for their new pets.</p>
