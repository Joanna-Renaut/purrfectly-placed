## Purrfectly Placed

A website for a fake cat adoption agency built as part of the Introduction to Web Development course by Code First Girls.

I used ChatGPT to create all the written content and made all the images in Midjourney.

This was my first time building a website whilst learning HTML, CSS and JS.

It is hosted on GitHub Pages [HERE:](https://joanna-renaut.github.io/purrfectly-placed/)
